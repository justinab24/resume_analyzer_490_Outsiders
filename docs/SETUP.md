# Running the project with Docker

- In order to run the project, you first must have docker installed on your machine

- Next, ensure the docker application is running

- Navigate to the root directory of the project and run 'docker-compose up --build' if first time or 'docker-compose up' if running again

- Please note: If you get a package not found issue in the frontend, try doing npm install inside the frontend folder to get all dependencies. Then rerun the docker build command.

- This command will build the docker containers as well as any needed dependencies for the project as specified in requirements.txt

- Once the build finishes it will be running automatically

- Use ^C to stop the application running
