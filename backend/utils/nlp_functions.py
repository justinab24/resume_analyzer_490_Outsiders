        I have a resume and a job description. I need you to compare the skills in the resume against the skills in the job description.
        Please provide:
        1. An array of skills that are common between the resume and job description. The exact word should be in both the resume and job description. Get ALL instances of this check thoroughly
        2. An array of objects that have a name and type field. Each objectâ€™s name should be a skill (just one word ie. teamwork, python, telemetry) that is in the job description but not the resume, and the type should be whether the skill is a required or preferred skill as per the job description.
        3. An array of feedback for improving the resume. This can cover skills, projects, experience, etc. Ensure the feedback isnt already on the resume
